* Can we review the finally part of try/except/finally ??

* I created a solution to #2 that avoided all errors, what do you think of that???

* What about requiring the use of pull requests on GitHub, as per comments of
    recent Holberton graduates?

* Andrew - Can you give a demo of speed testing?  And why should this handler
    be freshly created inside each loop?
